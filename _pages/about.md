# OPEN POSITION!
A two/three year postdoctoral position is open in Professor Kathryn Roeder's research group co-directed by Professor Jing Lei (http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/).  The successful candidate will apply cutting edge methods in statistics and machine learning to solve scientific problems emerging from genetics, using modern large-scale genomics data such as single-cell sequencing data.  We are looking for highly motivated individuals with a strong background in statistical methodology/theory, and a genuine interest in science and data-driven research.
Instructions: Send an email to roeder@andrew.cmu.edu including CV, research interests, links to your two best manuscripts, and a list of 3 references.

#About Me
I began my career as a biologist, but found that every question that interested me could only be answered by solving an even more intriguing statistical puzzle. Thus my career path veered into statistics. However, much of my work, both theoretical and applied, remains motivated by my scientific training.
 
The collaborative research I have enjoyed most is in the area of statistical genetics and genomics. Right now, a topic that interests me greatly is the use of statistical tools applied to genetic and genomic data to understand the workings of the human brain, and the interplay with genetic variation. For many years a primary goal of my research group is to develop statistical tools for finding associations between patterns of genetic variation and complex disease. Recently my collaborative work is primarily motivated by the goal of understanding the genetic etiology of autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We develop new tools for the analysis of rare genetic variants in the genome, single-cell RNA sequencing data and other multi-omic data. These methods rely on various statistical and machine learning methods, including graphical modeling, network community estimation and latent space embedding, sparse PCA and high dimensional nonparametric techniques.
